# 🌍 Climate Change Predictor & AI Advisor (Mobile App)

A mobile application that predicts future climate trends (like temperature, rainfall, and pollution) for a selected city using Machine Learning, and provides AI-powered suggestions to reduce climate risk. Built with React Native, Django REST API, and Python ML models.

---

## 📌 What is this project?

This is a cross-platform *mobile app* that:
- Predicts long-term climate data for specific cities
- Shows the predicted data in charts and visual formats
- Gives meaningful *AI-generated suggestions* based on prediction (e.g., what to do if temperature increases)
- Helps users understand and prepare for the *impacts of climate change*

---

## 💡 Why is this project useful?

Climate change affects every region differently, and it’s difficult for individuals or cities to plan ahead. This app:
- Helps users see the *future risks* (like heatwaves, low rainfall, or high pollution)
- Supports *early planning* for sustainability (planting trees, switching to green energy, etc.)
- Gives *city-level predictions*, making it practical and locally relevant
- Encourages people to *take action based on data*, not guesswork

> 🎯 In short: This project gives awareness + prediction + solution — all in one app.

## 🧩 What can people do with this app?

Users can:
- 📱 Choose their city
- 📊 See *climate prediction* for upcoming years (e.g., 2025)
- 📈 View *charts and graphs* showing temperature, rainfall, pollution
- 🤖 Get *smart suggestions* to reduce future climate risks
- 🌐 (Optional): See city location and risk data on a map

Developers can:
- Clone this repo and run the app locally
- Contribute by improving the model, UI, or adding cities
- Build additional features like chatbot, real-time data, or authentication
